                    	<p><strong>Q: What is the history of Nickel Management?</strong></p>
                        <p>We started accumulating our own portfolio of residential property in 2007. In early 2017 we formed Nickel Management to improve and professionalize the management of this portfolio. We have developed all of our methods, processes, and tools out of our desire to have a professional and successful rental portfolio. We are now bringing that accumulated expertise to other owners that would rather delegate their property management to a team that specializes in doing it very, very well.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: What kinds of property does Nickel Management manage?</strong></p>
                        <p>We will accept management responsibility for single family homes, apartments, and small commercial buildings in the Northern Hills area.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: How long does it take to transfer my property into the care of Nickel Management?</strong></p>
                        <p>We can typically complete the management transition process within two weeks of initial contact. All you need to do is respond to our requests for information and answer any questions our team may have. Larger properties with many tenants can take a bit longer, but we'll work with you to complete the transition as quickly as possible.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                		<p><strong>Q: My property needs some work before I'm comfortable renting it out. How does Nickel Management handle that?</strong></p>
                        <p>Many properties need a series of improvements before they are ready to perform well as income property. The tenants that will be drawn to the property are a direct reflection of the condition of the property, and it is very important that the home is safe, reliable, and free of lingering maintenance issues. Making repairs and improvments will also help maximize the amount of rent you can charge to ensure the success of your rental property. <br>
                        During inspection of your property, we will create a list of potential improvements and repairs that will maximize your rent and minimize your costs. We'll work with you to finalize the list of improvements, secure bids for any repair work, and manage the renovation process. Getting your property into top condition and quickly generating rental income for you is our top priority!</p>
                        <p><strong>Q: My property is currently rented, but I'm having trouble with my tenants. What will you do?</strong></p>
                        <p>As part of the transition of the property into our care, we wll gather a full history from you about your current tenants. If any of your tenants are not honoring their obligations under the lease, we'll give them the opportunity to do so and if necessary, manage the process of transitioning them out of the property and re-leasing the property to qualified tenants.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Q: My property is currently rented, but I think my rents are too low. What will you do?</strong></p>
                        <p>It is not uncommon for us to see rental property that has a great tenant paying rent but is way below market rates. As an owner, you need to first make the decision that your goal is to operate the property as a smart investment. Once you have made that decision, we'll work with your tenants to slowly but deliberately bring the rents to the market rate. It will be your tenant's decision to stay with the property or transition to other housing as this process of rent adjustment goes forward. Our experience is that most good tenants want to live in a well maintained property in the care of professional management and they are willing to pay market rents to do so.</p>
